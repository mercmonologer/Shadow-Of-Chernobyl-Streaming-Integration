# Shadow-Of-Chernobyl-Streaming-Integration

This repo is meant as guide for anyone looking to add streaming events integration into their STALKER: Shadow Of Chernobyl playthrough. Currently the default is to just spawn in different enemies around the player chracter when an event occurs, but you are free to modify and use the code in any way you wish for your purposes. The code here acts as an easy to set up ready to go solution or as an entry point for them to create further integrations and functionality so they don't have to struggle like I did to figure out how to do this. So Enjoy.

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
You will need to install/download the following pieces software/tools in order to successfully set up the integration as it currently exists
<h3>Required</h3>
<br/>
<ul>
 <li>A copy of STALKER: Shadow Of Chernobyl: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4500/STALKER_Shadow_of_Chernobyl/">Steam Page</a></li>
 <li>An account with either StreamLabs or StreamElements (I personally like StreamElements more but I'm not your dad ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)</li>
 <li>The latest version of Node.js: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">download here</a> </li>
 <li>The latest version of Microsoft Visual Studio (Visual Studio 2022 at time of writing): <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">download here</a> Note: You NEED to install the Desktop C++ workload set up when installing Visual Studio or else the compilation won't work</li>
 <li>Git for downloading build dependencies for the OGSR engine: <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">download here</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Reccommended</h3>
<br/>
<ul>
  <li>A code editor of your choice (I personally like <a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a>) to edit your node.js server file</li>

</ul>

<h1>Step 1: Downloading and modifying the OGSR Engine</h1>
<br/>

<br/>
<p>This is the main meat and potatoes of getting this set up</p>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Clone or download the repository at this <a href="https://github.com/OGSR/OGSR-Engine">location</a></li>
  <li>Clone or download this repository</li>
  <li>I reccommend that you put both folders on your desktop</li>
  <li>Open up this repository folder, go to code and copy MySocketServer.cpp, MySocketServer.hpp, ActorNetwork.cpp into the OGSR Engine folder shown below.
   <br/>
   <h2>Copy the three files circled below from this repo</h2>
   <img src="images/three_files.png"/>
   <br/>
   <h2>Paste them into the OGSR Engine/osgr_engine/xrGame folder shown below, if you get a prompt asking to replace a file, replace it that is intended</h2>
   <img src="images/Destination folder.png"/>
   <br/>
  <li>Go back to the root of the OGSR folder and click on the Engine.sln file shown below</li> 
  <br />
  <img src="images/engine.sln.png" />
  <br />
 <li>Visual Studio should open up and look like this</li>
  <br />
  <img src="images/visual studio 1.png" />
  <br />
 <li>On the right bar click on the xrGame drop down and then right click and click add->Existing Item</li>
   <br />
  <img src="images/add item.png" />
  <br />
  <li>Select MySocketServer.cpp in the file dialog and click add</li>
   <br />
  <img src="images/Add MySocketServer.cpp.png" />
  <br />
  <li>Confirm MySocketServer.cpp is included and then go to the to bar and click build->build solution</li>
   <br />
  <img src="images/Confirming my socket server.png" />
  <br />
  <img src="images/build.png" />
  <br />
  <li>Then allow Visual Studio to work it's magic and you should have a freshly baked engine executable in your \OGSR-Engine\bin_x64 folder</li>
    <br />
   <img src="images/NewEngine.png" />
  <br />
  <li>Next go to Steam, right click on STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl and go to Manage->Browse local Files (Or wherever the game folder is if you don't use Steam)</li>
      <br />
   <img src="images/local_files.png" />
  <br />
    <li>Drag and drop the new xrEngine executable into the STALKER game folder and do the same for the entire \OGSR-Engine\Resources_SoC_1.0006\gamedata folder (if you don't do this the game will crash at start up)</li>
   <br />
  <img src="images/moving_engine.png" />
  <br />
  <img src="images/moving_gamedata.png" />
  <br />
   <li>Now in the STALKER: Shadow Of Chernobyl game folder click on the newly moved xrEngine.exe and the game should start up.</li>
<br/>
<h2>Phew! That was the worst of it, but there is still some more work to do. Congratulations you just added a custom modification to a game engine!</h2> 
</ol>
<br>
<h1>Step 2: Setting up and modifying your Node.js Server</h1>
<ol>
 <li>In the code editor of your choice open up the server.js file from the code folder of this repo</li>
    <br />
  <img src="images/open_server.png" />
  <br />
  <li>It should look like this with alot of scary red lines, don't panic, this is intended</li>
    <br />
  <img src="images/server_file.png" />
  <br />
 <h2>This is where if you use StreamLabs things will differ for you and you will have to do some more work on your own to modify the server.js file to work with it as I do not use StreamLabs, this is currently set up for StreamElements. The process should be very similar for using StreamLabs and using their <a href="https://dev.streamlabs.com/docs/socket-api">documentation</a> and ChatGPT to help you. I may comeback and do a premade version for StreamLabs later, but I only have so much time.</h2>
<br/>
<br/>
<li>Now login to your StreamElements account(sign up for an account) and go to <a href="https://streamelements.com/dashboard/account/channels">your dashboard</a> and copy your JWT Token. <span style="color:red"> </span></li>$${\color{red}NOTE: DO NOT REVEAL/SEND THIS TOKEN TO ANYONE OTHERWISE THE CAN HAVE CONTROL OVER YOUR ACCOUNT!
